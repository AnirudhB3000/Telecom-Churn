# ðŸ’« About This Repository:
The telecommunications industry is highly competitive, with numerous organisations vying for customers' attention and loyalty. One of the biggest challenges facing these companies is churn, which refers to the rate at which customers leave for various reasons, including dissatisfaction with service or pricing, better offers from competitors, or changes in their circumstances. To address this issue, companies must understand the underlying factors that contribute to churn and be able to predict when it is likely to occur. While past churn rates can provide some insight into this phenomenon, they are not always reliable predictors of future behaviour. Other factors, such as changes in the competitive landscape or shifts in customer preferences, can impact churn rates in unpredictable ways.<br><br>
To overcome these limitations, we propose a method that combines past data predictions with customer feedback to generate a more accurate churn rate estimate for a particular period, such as a quarter or a year. This approach involves using machine learning algorithms to analyse past data and identify patterns and factors that contribute to churn. By analysing customer data, including demographics, location, job, and preferences, the algorithm can generate predictions about future churn rates. However, to further refine these predictions, the algorithm can also incorporate customer feedback, which can provide insights into the specific factors that are driving churn. Feedback can be collected through surveys, social media, or customer support interactions, and can provide valuable information about customers' experiences with the organisation. By combining past data predictions with customer feedback, organisations can gain a more accurate understanding of churn and take proactive steps to improve customer retention. This could involve changes to pricing or service offerings, improvements to customer support, or other strategies aimed at addressing the specific factors driving churn. By reducing churn, organisations can improve customer satisfaction and loyalty, ultimately benefiting both the company and the customer.<br><br>
